LITTLE LEMON is a Django-based restaurant app designed for use in a Coursera project. With LITTLE LEMON, users can browse the menu, place orders and make reservations, manage their accounts and profiles, and leave reviews and ratings for dishes.

This app is built using the Django web framework and Python programming language. It also uses the Djoser library for user authentication and management.

The source code for this app is available on GitHub at https://github.com/WajahatKanju/little-Lemon.

## Features

### Menu

LITTLE LEMON's menu features a wide variety of dishes to choose from. Users can browse the menu by category or search for specific dishes. Each dish has a detailed description, including ingredients, allergen information, and a photo.

### Ordering and Reservations

Users can place orders for pickup or delivery directly through the app. The ordering process is simple and intuitive, allowing users to customize their orders and add special instructions. Users can also make reservations for dine-in service at the restaurant.

### User Accounts and Profiles

LITTLE LEMON allows users to create accounts and manage their profiles using the Djoser library. Users can save their contact information, payment methods, and delivery addresses for faster checkout. They can also view their order history and track the status of current orders.

### Reviews and Ratings

LITTLE LEMON encourages users to leave reviews and ratings for dishes they have tried. Reviews are displayed on the dish's detail page, allowing other users to see what others thought of the dish before ordering. Users can also rate dishes on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
